### Raft Protocol

This is a Raft-like implementation of a consensus protocol.
For more detailed and concrete implementation ... consider the following references :
- [raft background](https://raft.github.io/)
- [etcd](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/tree/master/raft)
- [goraft](https://github.com/goraft/raft)

```
The Leader Election process has been left out of this implementation. 
In that sense , this is not a complete concensus protocol,
but only highlights some of the aspects related to maintaining a distributed state machine
```

TODO : benchmark raft with different consensus thresholds
